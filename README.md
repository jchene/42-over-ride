# Override - Exploiting ELF-32/64 binaries on x86_64 architecture

This project consists of multiple levels, each representing a unique challenge. The goal is to exploit vulnerabilities in each level to gain access to the next one.

## Structure

Each level in the project has the following structure:

- `flag`: A file containing the password for the next level.
- `README.md`: A file explaining how to solve the challenge for the current level.
- `Ressources/`: A directory containing resources needed to solve the challenge.
- `source`: The source code of the binary for the current level.

## Levels

Here is a list of the topics covered by each level:

- [Level 00](./level00/): The challenge for this level is ...

## Getting Started

To start, ssh with level00/level00 on 10.0.2.15:4242
