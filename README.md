# Override - Exploiting ELF-32/64 binaries on x86_64 architecture

This project consists of multiple levels, each representing a unique challenge. The goal is to exploit vulnerabilities in each level to gain access to the next one.

## Structure

Each level in the project has the following structure:

- `flag`: A file containing the password for the next level.
- `Ressources/`: A directory containing resources needed to solve the challenge.
- `Ressources/README.md`: A file explaining how to solve the challenge for the current level.
- `source`: A human readable source code version of the binary for the current level.

## Levels

Here is a list of the topics covered by each level:

- [Level 00 - PLAIN PASSWORD](./level00/)
- [Level 01 - STACK BUFFER OVERFLOW 1](./level01/)
- [Level 02 - FORMAT STRING EXPLOITATION 1](./level02/)
- [Level 03 - ENCRYPTED PASSWORD](./level03/)
- [Level 04 - STACK BUFFER OVERFLOW 2 (SYSCALL BAN)](./level04/)
- [Level 05 - ](./level05/)
- [Level 06 - ](./level06/)
- [Level 07 - ](./level07/)
- [Level 08 - ](./level08/)
- [Level 09 - ](./level09/)
